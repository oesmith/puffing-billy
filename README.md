# Puffing Billy

A rewriting web proxy for testing interactions between your browser and
external sites. Works with ruby + rspec.

Puffing Billy is like [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) or
[VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr), but for your browser.

## Overview

Billy spawns an EventMachine-based proxy server, which it uses to intercept
requests sent by your browser. It has a simple API for configuring which
requests need stubbing and what they should return.

Billy lets you test against known, repeatable data.  It also allows you to
test for failure cases.  Does your twitter (or facebook/google/etc)
integration degrade gracefully when the API starts returning 500s?  Well now
you can test it!

```ruby
it 'should stub google' do
  proxy.stub('http://www.google.com/').and_return(:text => "I'm not Google!")
  visit 'http://www.google.com/'
  page.should have_content("I'm not Google!")
end
```

You can also record HTTP interactions and replay them later. See
[caching](#caching) below.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'puffing-billy'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install puffing-billy

## RSpec Usage

In your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'billy/rspec'

# select a driver for your chosen browser environment
Capybara.javascript_driver = :selenium_billy
# Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit_billy
# Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist_billy
```

In your tests:

```ruby
# Stub and return text, json, jsonp (or anything else)
proxy.stub('http://example.com/text/').and_return(:text => 'Foobar')
proxy.stub('http://example.com/json/').and_return(:json => { :foo => 'bar' })
proxy.stub('http://example.com/jsonp/').and_return(:jsonp => { :foo => 'bar' })
proxy.stub('http://example.com/headers/').and_return({
  :headers => { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' => '*' },
  :json    => { :foo => 'bar' }
})
proxy.stub('http://example.com/wtf/').and_return(:body => 'WTF!?', :content_type => 'text/wtf')

# Stub redirections and other return codes
proxy.stub('http://example.com/redirect/').and_return(:redirect_to => 'http://example.com/other')
proxy.stub('http://example.com/missing/').and_return(:code => 404, :body => 'Not found')

# Even stub HTTPS!
proxy.stub('https://example.com:443/secure/').and_return(:text => 'secrets!!1!')

# Pass a Proc (or Proc-style object) to create dynamic responses.
#
# The proc will be called with the following arguments:
#   params:  Query string parameters hash, CGI::escape-style
#   headers: Headers hash
#   body:    Request body string
#
proxy.stub('https://example.com/proc/').and_return(Proc.new { |params, headers, body|
  { :text => "Hello, #{params['name'][0]}"}
})
```

Stubs are reset between tests.  Any requests that are not stubbed will be
proxied to the remote server.

## Cucumber Usage

In your `features/support/env.rb`:

```ruby
require 'billy/cucumber'

After do
  Capybara.use_default_driver
end
```

An example feature:

```
Feature: Stubbing via billy

  @javascript @billy
  Scenario: Test billy
    And a stub for google
```

And in steps:

```
Before('@billy') do
  Capybara.current_driver = :poltergeist_billy
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist_billy
end

And /^a stub for google$/ do
  proxy.stub('http://www.google.com/').and_return(:text => "I'm not Google!")
  visit 'http://www.google.com/'
  page.should have_content("I'm not Google!")
end
```

It's good practice to reset the driver after each scenario, so having an 
`@billy` tag switches the drivers on for a given scenario. Also note that 
stubs are reset after each step, so any usage of a stub should be in the 
same step that it was created in.

## Caching

Requests routed through the external proxy are cached.

By default, all requests to localhost or 127.0.0.1 will not be cached. If
you're running your test server with a different hostname, you'll need to
add that host to puffing-billy's whitelist.

In your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
Billy.configure do |c|
  c.whitelist = ['test.host', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
end
```

If you want to use puffing-billy like you would [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)
you can turn on cache persistence. This way you don't have to manually mock out
everything as requests are automatically recorded and played back. With cache
persistence you can take tests completely offline.

```ruby
Billy.configure do |c|
  c.cache = true
  c.ignore_params = ["http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif",
                     "https://r.twimg.com/jot",
                     "http://p.twitter.com/t.gif",
                     "http://p.twitter.com/f.gif",
                     "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php",
                     "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth",
                     "http://cdn.api.twitter.com/1/urls/count.json"]
  c.persist_cache = true
  c.cache_path = 'spec/req_cache/'
end

# need to call this because of a race condition between persist_cache
# being set and the proxy being loaded for the first time
Billy.proxy.restore_cache
```

`c.ignore_params` is used to ignore parameters of certain requests when
caching. You should mostly use this for analytics and various social buttons as
they use cache avoidance techniques, but return practically the same response
that most often does not affect your test results.

The cache works with all types of requests and will distinguish between
different POST requests to the same URL.

## Customising the javascript driver

If you use a customised Capybara driver, remember to set the proxy address
and tell it to ignore SSL certificate warnings. See
[lib/billy/rspec.rb](https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy/blob/master/lib/billy/rspec.rb)
to see how Billy's default drivers are configured.

## FAQ

1. Why name it after a train?

   Trains are *cool*.
